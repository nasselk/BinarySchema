# BinarySchema

BinarySchema is a TypeScript type-safe binary serialization library using declarative schemas. It delivers full IDE autocompletion, bit-level encoding for minimal output sizes, and support for arrays and various types—perfect for game networking and real-time data transmission.

> **⚠️ Warning: Pre-release Status**  
> This library is **not yet published to npm**. It aims to become an npm package in the future, but for now:
> - **No versioning**: You'll need to manually check the repository for updates and copy the source files
> - **TypeScript source only**: The library is distributed as TypeScript files, so it's not directly suitable for JavaScript environments without a transpiler/build step
> - **Manual integration**: You'll need to copy the `src/` files into your project or reference them directly

## Building / running locally

Requirements: Node.js (v20+ recommended) and npm.

1. Install dev dependencies (optional, for formatting/type checks):

```pwsh
npm install
```

2. Type-check or compile (TypeScript):

```pwsh
npx tsc --project tsconfig.json
```

3. Run examples directly with Node (if using ESM and TypeScript is compiled to JS), or run with ts-node / bun if you prefer.

## Notes

The inline documentation (JSDoc comments) and portions of this README were partially written with AI assistance.
